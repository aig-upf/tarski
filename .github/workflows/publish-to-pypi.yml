# We assume that releases are made from master branch, which is protected against direct pushes, and hence all code
# there will have successfully run through all unit test, etc. in the PR-configured workflows.
# Note that the actual publishing to pypi is further protected with an extra if-check that checks that the pushed
# reference is a tag.
