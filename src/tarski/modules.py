""" A helper module to deal with import of packages that depend on the installation of certain pip extras,
to keep Tarski modular and lightweight for simple uses, but optionally heavyweight for more sophisticated uses. """

# TODO: Whenever we raise the Python requirement to Python >= 3.7, we should migrate this to a
#       better interface providing direct access to the desired package, e.g. allowing "from tarski.modules import sdd",
#       which can be easily achieved with the new module-level __getattr__
