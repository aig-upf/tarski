class StateVariableLite:
    """ A state variable is a ground CompoundTerm or Atom which can possibly change its value along the execution of a
    plan. The set of all state variables of a problem makes up all information necessary to represent a state.
    State variables are different to static atoms, whose truth value can be proven to remain the same.
    This proof can be based on simple techniques such as looking at the effects of actions, or on more sophisticated
    reachability analyses.

    Note that we could use the CompoundTerm or Atom classes to represent the same concept represented by a
    StateVariableLite, but currently we prefer to use a single class, hence the existence of StateVariableLite.
    Note: This is a lightweight version of the StateVariable class above, hoping that it can eventually replace it.
